Overview
- Developed an algorithm to linearize a curve, such as a sine wave, in the most optimal way.
- Implemented and compared three approaches:
  - Greedy algorithm
  - Dynamic programming (DP)
  - Neural network (multi-layer perceptron, or MLP)

Methods
- Greedy: Adds breakpoints where local linear approximation exceeds a fixed error threshold.
- Dynamic Programming: Finds the minimum number of linear segments that globally stay within a maximum error.
- Neural Network (MLP): Learns to predict breakpoints using supervised training on sine curves.

Evaluation
- Each method is evaluated on:
  - Mean squared error (MSE) between the original and linearized curves
  - Number of segments used
  - MSE against a clean (ground truth) sine curve, when available

Tests
- Evaluated methods on a variety of test curves, including:
  - Clean sine waves
  - Noisy sine waves
  - Flat lines
  - High-frequency curves
  - Random noise
